🏏 CricketPulse – Real-Time T20 Score Predictor

CricketPulse is a machine learning-powered web application designed to predict T20 cricket match scores using real-time match data and advanced ML algorithms.

📍 College Project Details

College: G.L. Bajaj Institute of Technology and Management

Student Name: Divyansh Singh

Course & Branch: B.Tech CS (AIML)

Theme: Sports

⚠️ Problem Statement

T20 cricket score prediction is complex due to fast-paced gameplay, sudden wicket losses, changing run rates, and varying pitch conditions. Most existing tools are simplistic and ignore this dynamic interplay.

🎯 Objectives

Build an ML model to predict T20 scores using real-time inputs (overs, runs, wickets, etc.)

Create an intuitive web interface for user interaction.

Integrate frontend, backend, and ML to provide seamless live predictions.

💡 Motivation

The explosive growth of T20 cricket calls for better analytics and prediction systems. This project combines a love for cricket with the power of XGBoost and ML to deliver a smart, predictive solution.
